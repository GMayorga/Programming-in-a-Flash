# Programming-in-a-Flash

This website was made for my final project in my Fall 2018 web development class at Rowan University. 

I hosted the website on Rowan's servers, so if the page goes down after I graduate, I will seek an alternative host.

For now, the website can be found here: http://elvis.rowan.edu/~mayorgag4/webdev/8-finalwebdev/main_page.html

The website can be also found here: https://gmayorga.github.io/Programming-in-a-Flash/ However, Github does not display php so you can't see all the website features.
